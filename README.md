# RESTful API with .NET, Docker and React

This project demonstrates how to build a professional-grade RESTful API from scratch using ASP.NET Core, with a focus on security, scalability, and real-world practices. It includes integration with a React frontend and deployment using Docker and GitHub Actions.

## üìå Key Features

- ‚úÖ Fully RESTful API with resource-based routes
- ‚úÖ JWT authentication with access and refresh tokens via **HttpOnly Cookies**
- ‚úÖ Secure OAuth login (e.g., Google) using Authorization Code
- ‚úÖ Versioning, Pagination, File Upload & Download support
- ‚úÖ **HATEOAS** implementation to enrich responses
- ‚úÖ Swagger (OpenAPI) documentation
- ‚úÖ Clean Architecture with Business, Repository, and Controller layers
- ‚úÖ Docker and Docker Compose for local development
- ‚úÖ Secure HTTPS with NGINX reverse proxy
- ‚úÖ Continuous Integration and Deployment using GitHub Actions

## üîê Security Architecture

| Component                  | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Access Token              | Stored in HttpOnly, Secure Cookie with short expiration (~15 min)          |
| Refresh Token             | Stored in HttpOnly, Secure Cookie with long expiration (~7 days)           |
| Authentication Flow       | OAuth 2.0 Authorization                                                    |
| Token Refresh             | Done via `/refresh` endpoint using cookie, without exposing new token      |
| Session Info              | Retrieved via `/me` endpoint (protected by `Authorize`)                    |
| CORS                      | Configured to allow cross-origin requests with `withCredentials`           |
| Secure Cookies            | Sent only over HTTPS with `SameSite=None` for cross-domain compatibility   |
| Token Reading             | Tokens are read from cookies (not headers) via `OnMessageReceived` hook    |
| Logout Flow               | Deletes access and refresh token cookies                                   |

‚úÖ **Protected Against**:
- XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
- CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
- Token Theft / Replay Attacks
- Unauthorized API access

| Concept                     | Applied in Project                             |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| REST Maturity Model        | Level 3 (with HATEOAS and content negotiation)  |
| REST Verbs                 | GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE                   |
| URL Parameters             | Query, Path, Header, Body                       |
| API Versioning             | URL versioning (`v1`, `v2`)                     |
| Pagination                 | Via query params (page, limit)                 |
| Media Types                | Supports `application/json`, `application/xml` |
| Content Negotiation        | Based on `Accept` headers                      |

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Run Locally (Dev)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/gfabrissouza/react-client-restful-api-dotnet
cd react-client-restful-api-dotnet

# Launch Docker containers
docker-compose up --build
```

- React frontend runs on: `http://localhost:5173`
- Backend API runs on: `https://localhost:443`
- Swagger UI: `https://localhost/swagger`
- Swagger UI (Docker): `http://localhost:81/swagger`
---

## üß© Frontend React Integration

- Uses `withCredentials: true` in Axios to include cookies
- Calls `/me` to get session data
- Automatically refreshes tokens using silent requests
- Fully cross-domain compatible with secure CORS config
